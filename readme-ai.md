##  Overview

The software project comprises an Electron app frontend that interfaces with a Flask backend, providing seamless interaction and functionality. The main JavaScript file, test_main.js, initiates and manages the Electron app window, ensuring connectivity with the Flask backend, monitoring its health, handling reconnections as needed, and facilitating file saving operations. The frontend app also responds to system sleep events, guaranteeing uninterrupted performance. On the backend side, the BWCT_app.py file serves as the core logic, orchestrating routing, data processing, and communication with the frontend. This essential file encapsulates critical business logic and ensures smooth interactions between various components within the application. Additionally, a track_logs.txt file maintains a record of frame processing, offering valuable insights into the projects operational progress. Altogether, this projects value lies in its ability to provide a responsive, integrated system combining frontend and backend functionalities to deliver a seamless user experience while handling complex data processing tasks effectively.
